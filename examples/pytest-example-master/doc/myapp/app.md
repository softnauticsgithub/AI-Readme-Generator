# Documentation for the MyApp Module Functions

This documentation provides an overview of the functions defined in the Python module that utilizes the `multiply` and `divide` functions imported from `myapp.mymodule.funcs`. The module contains two utility functions that perform multiplication and division operations specifically by the number 2.

## Description

The module works with basic arithmetic operations of multiplication and division. It features two main functions, `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two`, which leverage the imported functions `multiply` and `divide` respectively to perform their tasks. 

These functions are useful for scaling values or reducing them by a factor of 2, often required in data processing tasks.

## Functions

### multiply_by_two

```python
def multiply_by_two(x):
    return multiply(x, 2)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `x` (numeric): The number to be multiplied.

- **Returns:**
  - The product of `x` and 2.

- **Description:**
  This function takes a numeric input `x` and returns the result of multiplying `x` by 2. It uses the `multiply` function from `myapp.mymodule.funcs`.

### divide_by_two

```python
def divide_by_two(x):
    return divide(x, 2)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `x` (numeric): The number to be divided.

- **Returns:**
  - The result of dividing `x` by 2.

- **Description:**
  This function takes a numeric input `x` and returns the result of dividing `x` by 2. It uses the `divide` function from `myapp.mymodule.funcs`.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two` functions:

### Example 1: Using multiply_by_two

```python
result = multiply_by_two(5)
print(result)  # Output: 10
```

### Example 2: Using divide_by_two

```python
result = divide_by_two(10)
print(result)  # Output: 5.0
```

### Example 3: Using multiply_by_two with a negative number

```python
result = multiply_by_two(-3)
print(result)  # Output: -6
```

### Example 4: Using divide_by_two with a float

```python
result = divide_by_two(7.5)
print(result)  # Output: 3.75
```

These examples illustrate how to utilize the functions effectively for different numeric inputs. You can use these functions for various applications, such as data analysis, mathematical computations, or anywhere you need to scale or reduce numbers by a factor of 2. 

## Conclusion

The functions `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two` provide a straightforward way to perform basic arithmetic operations specifically with the number 2. They demonstrate the utility of modular programming by using imported functions from other modules, promoting code reuse and organization.
