# Documentation for `myapp` Command-Line Application

This Python script serves as a simple command-line interface that takes an integer input from the user and performs two basic arithmetic operations: multiplying the input by two and dividing the input by two. It imports two functions, `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two`, from the `myapp.app` module to perform these calculations.

## Features

- Accepts user input from the command line.
- Multiplies the input number by two and prints the result.
- Divides the input number by two and prints the result.
- Gracefully exits the application after performing the calculations.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Save the script in a Python file, e.g., `app.py`.
3. Ensure that the necessary module `myapp.app` with `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two` functions is accessible in your Python environment.
4. Run the script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompt to insert a number.

## Requirements

This application requires the following:
- Python 3.x
- The `myapp` package containing the `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two` functions.

## Functions

### main()

The `main` function is the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to input an integer, performs the arithmetic operations using the imported functions, and displays the results.

#### Implementation Details

- **Input**: The function prompts the user to insert an integer.
- **Processing**:
  - Calls `multiply_by_two(num)` to compute the double of the input.
  - Calls `divide_by_two(num)` to compute the half of the input.
- **Output**: Prints the results of both operations in a formatted string.
- **Exit**: Calls `sys.exit(0)` to terminate the program.

## Example

When the script is executed, here is a sample interaction:

```plaintext
Insert a number: 10
The double of 10 is 20
The half of 10 is 5
```

In this example:
- The user inputs `10`.
- The application calculates and prints `20` as the double and `5` as the half of `10`.

## Conclusion

This script demonstrates basic input handling and arithmetic operations in Python. With the proper external functions defined in the `myapp.app` module, it forms a simple but effective utility that can be expanded upon for more complex features in the future.
