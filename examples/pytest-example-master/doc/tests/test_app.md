# Documentation for the Test Suite of `myapp.app`

This documentation outlines the functionalities and test cases of the functions `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two` from the `myapp.app` module. The test suite is written using the `pytest` framework and validates these functions with predefined input values.

## Description

This test suite checks the functionality of two mathematical operations:
1. **Multiplication** of a number by two.
2. **Division** of a number by two.

The functions must behave as expected when tested against known values.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the tests:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

## Usage Examples

To run the tests defined in this file, you can use the following command:
```bash
pytest test_app.py
```

Replace `test_app.py` with the actual filename where this test is stored.

## Test Fixtures

### `numbers`

A fixture named `numbers` is defined to provide a list of two integers to the test methods. This fixture initializes:
- `a = 10`
- `b = 20`

The fixture returns the values as a list:
```python
def numbers():
    a = 10
    b = 20
    return [a, b]
```

The fixture is injected into the test methods, allowing them to use the same set of inputs.

## Test Class: `TestApp`

The `TestApp` class contains methods that test the functionality of the `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two` functions.

### Method: `test_multiplication`

```python
def test_multiplication(self, numbers):
    res = multiply_by_two(numbers[0])
    assert res == numbers[1]
```

- **Description**: This test method checks whether the `multiply_by_two` function correctly multiplies the first number from the `numbers` fixture by two.
- **Logic**:
  - Calls `multiply_by_two` with `numbers[0]` (which is `10`).
  - Asserts that the result is equal to `numbers[1]` (which is `20`).

### Method: `test_division`

```python
def test_division(self, numbers):
    res = divide_by_two(numbers[1])
    assert res == numbers[0]
```

- **Description**: This test method verifies that the `divide_by_two` function correctly divides the second number from the `numbers` fixture by two.
- **Logic**:
  - Calls `divide_by_two` with `numbers[1]` (which is `20`).
  - Asserts that the result is equal to `numbers[0]` (which is `10`).

## Conclusion

This test suite efficiently validates the correctness of the mathematical operations performed by the `multiply_by_two` and `divide_by_two` functions. By utilizing pytest fixtures, it ensures a clean and manageable testing structure. Be sure to execute the tests in an environment where the `myapp.app` module is accessible to ensure that the tests function correctly.
