# Documentation for the Test Suite in `myapp.mymodule`

This document describes the test suite for the mathematical operations defined in the `myapp.mymodule.funcs` module. The test suite uses the `pytest` framework to define and run unit tests on various mathematical functions.

## Description

This test suite contains unit tests for basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each mathematical operation is tested by asserting that the output of a function matches the expected result. The tests are categorized into two groups using `pytest` markers: `easy_operation` for simpler arithmetic operations and `difficult_operation` for slightly more complex operations.

## Setup

Before running the tests, ensure that you have installed the `pytest` framework. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

## Usage Examples

To run the tests defined in this suite, navigate to the directory containing the test file and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pytest <test_filename>.py
```

Replace `<test_filename>` with the name of the Python file containing the test code.

## Test Cases

### 1. Test Add

```python
@pytest.mark.easy_operation
def test_add():
    # This test will fail.
    assert add(4, 8) == 14
```

- **Description**: Tests the `add` function to verify that it correctly performs addition.
- **Expected Behavior**: This test is expected to fail (as noted in the code) because `4 + 8` should equal `12`, not `14`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `add(4, 8)`: Calls the addition function with parameters 4 and 8.
  
### 2. Test Subtract

```python
@pytest.mark.easy_operation
def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(3, 6) == -3
```

- **Description**: Tests the `subtract` function to verify that it correctly performs subtraction.
- **Expected Behavior**: This test should pass as the result of `3 - 6` correctly yields `-3`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `subtract(3, 6)`: Calls the subtraction function with parameters 3 and 6.

### 3. Test Multiply

```python
@pytest.mark.difficult_operation
def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(4, 5) == 20
```

- **Description**: Tests the `multiply` function to ensure it performs multiplication correctly.
- **Expected Behavior**: This test should pass as the result of `4 * 5` is indeed `20`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `multiply(4, 5)`: Calls the multiplication function with parameters 4 and 5.

### 4. Test Divide

```python
@pytest.mark.difficult_operation
def test_divide():
    assert divide(56, 8) == 7
```

- **Description**: Tests the `divide` function to ensure it performs division correctly.
- **Expected Behavior**: This test should pass as the result of `56 / 8` is `7`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `divide(56, 8)`: Calls the division function with parameters 56 and 8.

## Conclusion

This test suite provides a concise yet effective method of verifying the correctness of arithmetic functions within the `myapp.mymodule` module. By using `pytest` markers, these tests are organized into categories, making it simpler to identify which tests pertain to basic operations versus more complex operations. Ensure that all function implementations in `myapp.mymodule.funcs` are correctly defined to uphold the expected results in the tests.
